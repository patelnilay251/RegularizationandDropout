# Regularization and Dropout in Neural Networks

This repository contains Python code examples demonstrating the implementation of regularization techniques and dropout in neural networks using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Introduction

Regularization techniques and dropout are essential concepts in the field of deep learning to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of neural networks. This repository provides practical examples and demonstrations of how to apply regularization techniques such as L2 regularization and dropout in neural network models.

## Dependencies

To run the code examples in this repository, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy

You can install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy

```bash
git clone https://github.com/patelnilay251/RegularizationandDropout.git

```bash
cd RegularizationandDropout

## Regularization

The RegularizationAlgorithm.py script demonstrates how to implement  regularization in a neural network using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Dropout

The DropoutAlgorithm.py script shows how to implement dropout in a neural network to prevent overfitting.
